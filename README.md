##This Program allows user to read,create,write and append data in a file using C.I have used fopen,fclose,fputs and fgets inbuilt file functions. The logic behind the program is that it accepts file name and displays menu options until the loop exits. Switch case handles each operation like create,write,read and append. NOTE:Each operation checks for file opening errors using NULL pointer.This helped me to understand the concepts regarding external data storage in c.
